## Course Materials
- **starter** : contains all the notebooks, that are empty in order to follow along.
- **final** : contains all the notebooks with all the source code.


## Course Structure
The course is structured in **15 sessions**, where each session is composed of the following elements
  - **Lesson** introducing new concepts and building on concepts from previous **Lessons**
  - **Project** to try out the new concepts
  - **YouTube** video explaining and demonstrating the concepts
    - A walkthrough of concepts in **Lesson** with demonstrating coding examples
    - An introduction of the **Project**
    - A **solution** of the project
